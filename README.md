# Disaster-Analysis-From-Tweets
Analyzed the correlation between regional disaster and where tweets came from.	
	
#Tools we used: 	
Apache Flume for collecting data from tweeter with the setting that filtered out only tweets with "nepal earthquake" and "houston flood"	
Apache HIVE for extracting useful message with the usage of JSON Serde	
D3.js and Goole Map API for visualize the data with bar charts and heat maps.	

#Result:		
We found that people tweeted more about the disaster. For example, people in Houston and Texas area tweeted more flood.
