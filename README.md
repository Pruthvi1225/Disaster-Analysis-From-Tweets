# Disaster-Analysis-From-Tweets
Analyzed the correlation between regional disaster and where tweets came from.	
	
#Tools we used	
Apache Flume version 1.6 for collecting data from tweeter with the setting that filtered out only tweets with "nepal earthquake" and "houston flood".
Apache HIVE version 1.2.1 for extracting useful message with the usage of JSON Serde.	
D3.js version 3.5.5 and Goole Map API for visualize the data with bar charts and heat maps.	

#Result		
We found that people tweeted more about the disaster. For example, people in Houston and Texas area tweeted more flood.
